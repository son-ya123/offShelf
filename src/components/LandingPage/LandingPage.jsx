This waste occurs at all stages of the food supply chain, from production to processing to distribution to consumption.

Food waste has a number of negative consequences. It's a waste of resources, including water, land, and energy. It also contributes to climate change, as food waste that decomposes in landfills produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Food waste also has a social impact. While we're wasting food, millions of people around the world are going hungry. In fact, every 12 seconds, a child dies from hunger. 
We can all help to reduce food waste and make a difference for the environment and for the people who are hungry. */}</div>
